default error messages http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-transactioninactiveerror

_rawObjectStore.indexes -> _rawObjectStore.rawIndexes

array and DOMStringList are not the same
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMStringList
- see IDBDatabase.deleteObjectStore.js

events implementation
- if "cancelable", should be possible to call e.preventDefault() and canel the "default action" (such as aborting a transaction)
  - example is the _canceled check in FDBTransaction

share some code between Index and ObjectStore, like getValue, confirmActiveTransaction

TRICKY THINGS TO FIGURE OUT (and test) ASAP:
- transaction and request scheduling
  - reevaluate all uses of setTimeout, setImmediate, and process.nextTick
  - that setTimeout thing will lead to stuff out of order if triggered
- transaction abort/rollback
  - also include key generator state somehow
  - objectStoreNames, indexNames
- indexes
- cursors

creating object stores, keys

transactions
- event interaction with transaction: http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-fire-a-success-event

convert tests from web-platform-tests and delete as i go
- missing:
  - test of aborted transaction rollback
  - (because of assert.throws I think) error propagation to transaction rejection

events should have stopPropagation and preventDefault and such
- "The propagation path for the event is the transaction's connection, then transaction and finally request."

break events stuff into separate module

asyncify
- currently using setImmediate for transaction resolution and process.nextTick for queueing everything else

indexes
- research how to store data
- or maybe use something like https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb to actually store data
- initially, just don't. sort/filter as needed

"return this" needed at bottom of functions?

_ properties should be hidden from standard functions
- also nice toStrings
