use browserify to create bundle for browser
- should somehow export fakeIndexedDB and FDB* classes to window
- then could run on tests (w3c or other) if i rename all the appropriate variables first

try BBGM
- works when i get rid of the this._active=false after request.dispatchEvent inside FDBTransaction._start. WHY?

convert tests from web-platform-tests and delete as i go
- missing:
  - comprehensive tests of aborted transaction rollback
  - (because of assert.throws I think) error propagation to transaction rejection
  - multiple transactions interacting, like readwrite blocking another but allowing readonly
  - multiple transactions on the same object stores in multiple connections
  - IDBObjectStore.openCursor with various valid arguments
  - openKeyCursor actually being used to retrieve keys
  - IDBObjectStore.index returns the same or different IDBIndex depending on situation http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#widl-IDBObjectStore-index-IDBIndex-DOMString-name

Other tests
- ideally run these in the browser (and w3c original ones too)
  - https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink/+/72fef91ac1ef679207f51def8133b336a6f6588f/LayoutTests/storage/indexeddb
  - https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/tree/master/dom/indexedDB/test

redo transaction/request lifetime
- current implementations feel a bit hacky/ugly
- multiple readonly transactions should be allowed to run at the same time (but not readwrite, they should be all alone)

objectStoreNames and indexNames should be DOMStringLists
- see https://github.com/facebookarchive/IndexedDB-polyfill/blob/master/indexedDB.polyfill.js#L36
- http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html#DOMStringList
- do real implementations really not support [] indexing?

readonly properties need to actually be readonly
- done in FDBCursor, but messy if other classes need to update a value that is to be presented to the user as readonly, like FDBCursorWithValue.value

share some code between Index and ObjectStore, like getValue, confirmActiveTransaction
- similar thing between open and deleteDatabase

break events stuff into separate module, maybe fakeDOMEvents
- readonly properties? hidden/non-enumerable properties?

go through and fix all the left comments (todo stuff)

reevaluate all uses of setImmedaite, setTimeout, nextTick

_ properties should be hidden from standard functions
- object.defineProperty enumerable?

Change comment links to http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-IndexedDB-20150108/ which will be stable

For .filter calls that are deleting items from arrays (such as ObjectStore.deleteRecord) it might be faster to use splice as iterating over the array

btree? slice to add to middle of array is slow http://jsperf.com/splicing-a-single-value/19
- probably best: http://goneill.co.nz/btree.php

default error messages http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-transactioninactiveerror

what if my backend data storage was async? should make it easier to plug-and-play things besides JS objects

findIndex (and similar) could be replaced by smarter searches, like binary search if we know the list is sorted
- Given an array sorted in ascending order, find the lowest value of i where array[i] >= x
  - use this to replace findIndex in storeInIndex in Index.js
