TRICKY THINGS TO FIGURE OUT (and test) ASAP:
- transaction and request scheduling
- transaction abort/rollback
  - also include key generator state somehow
- indexes
  - FDBIndex just accesses an index. data stored elsewhere (where?)
    - actually object stores have the same problem - the interface and underlying object store need to be separate, because multiple instances of the interface could be active at the same time
    - same with databases. and probably anything with this._ properties
  - store key/value pairs taht are indexKey/recordKey
- cursors

creating object stores, keys

transactions
- event interaction with transaction: http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-fire-a-success-event

convert tests from web-platform-tests and delete as i go
- missing:
  - test of aborted transaction rollback

events should have stopPropagation and preventDefault and such
- "The propagation path for the event is the transaction's connection, then transaction and finally request."


asyncify
- currently using setImmediate for transaction resolution and process.nextTick for queueing everything else

indexes
- research how to store data
- or maybe use something like https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb to actually store data
- initially, just don't. sort/filter as needed

"return this" needed at bottom of functions?
