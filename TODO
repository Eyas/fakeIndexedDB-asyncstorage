special cmp functions needed soon

remove fireEvent, just build them manually? Or http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-steps-for-asynchronously-executing-a-request

default error messages http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-transactioninactiveerror

_ for internal properties

TRICKY THINGS TO FIGURE OUT (and test) ASAP:
- transaction abort/rollback
- indexes
- cursors

http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/

creating object stores, keys
- http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#versionchange-transaction-steps

transactions
- event interaction with transaction: http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-fire-a-success-event

convert tests from web-platform-tests and delete as i go

asyncify
- currently using setImmediate for transaction resolution and process.nextTick for queueing everything else

indexes
- research how to store data
- or maybe use something like https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb to actually store data
- initially, just don't. sort/filter as needed
