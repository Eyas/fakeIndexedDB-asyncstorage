default error messages http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-transactioninactiveerror

share some code between Index and ObjectStore, like getValue, confirmActiveTransaction

don't like the naming conventions for database/index/objectstore. should prefix the interface instances with fdb

TRICKY THINGS TO FIGURE OUT (and test) ASAP:
- transaction and request scheduling
  - reevaluate all uses of setTimeout, setImmediate, and process.nextTick
- transaction abort/rollback
  - also include key generator state somehow
  - objectStoreNames, indexNames
- indexes
- cursors

creating object stores, keys
- http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#versionchange-transaction-steps

transactions
- event interaction with transaction: http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-fire-a-success-event

convert tests from web-platform-tests and delete as i go
- missing:
  - test of aborted transaction rollback

events should have stopPropagation and preventDefault and such
- "The propagation path for the event is the transaction's connection, then transaction and finally request."


asyncify
- currently using setImmediate for transaction resolution and process.nextTick for queueing everything else

indexes
- research how to store data
- or maybe use something like https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb to actually store data
- initially, just don't. sort/filter as needed

"return this" needed at bottom of functions?
