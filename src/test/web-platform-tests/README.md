These tests come from [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/IndexedDB) as of April 2017.

To update them, clone that repo, copy over the IndexedDB folder, and run the convert.js script. Assuming nothing substantial has changed in the structure of the tests, that should be all you have to do.
