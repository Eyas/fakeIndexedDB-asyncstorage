These tests come from [indexedDBmock](https://github.com/kristofdegrave/indexedDBmock) as of 2015-05-07. The only difference is that I had to change index.html a bit to make it run. Besides that, newer versions of those tests should just work if they're dropped in here and the reference in index.html is updated.

These are browser-only tests for now.
