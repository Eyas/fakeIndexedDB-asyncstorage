These tests come from https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/IndexedDB but they are designed to run in a web browser, which is annoying for this project. So I am gradually converting them to Mocha tests, which is kind of annoyiong, but not very difficult. Possibly this is a horrible idea, but ultimately it will work.
